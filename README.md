# Caseta
Tape reader Android app for Amstrad CPC

Do you have an Amstrad/Schneider CPC stowed away in a closet? Would you like to try out new software/games on it, but you have no way of transferring it from your PC. Just use Caseta, the Android app emulating a tape reader! It includes support for start/stop control using the microphone.
